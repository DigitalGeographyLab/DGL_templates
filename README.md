# What is this?

This repository contains templates for repository readme (readme.md) files. There are a few templates to choose from for now there are two options: minimal and detailed.
* *Minimal* is better for internal use and contains minimal and straight-forward guidelines how to use the code in the repo
* *Detailed* is better for public repos where you give visitors more information about the tool, research context etc.

# Why is it here?

The templates are here to help DGL researches publish their code/scripts on GitHub and to harmonize the readme structure across the repositories.

# How do I use the templates?

You select the file you want ([detailed](detailed.md) or [minimal](minimal.md)), copy paste its content to your own GitHub repository's readme.md file. Then replace the pig latin text with your own.
